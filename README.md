# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this study guide webpage as a way to get a headstart on my coding bootcamp. 
I wanted to learn the basics of coding, versioning, and deploying a webpage.
This application shows what I learned during the prework course and allowed me to play with the different coding languages as well as learning the basics of GitHub.

## Installation

## Usage

This study guide can be used to store info that I learn about HTML, CSS, Git, and JS. The purpose is to not only develop my coding skills, but track and internalize what I have learned so far. To view suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by right click, inspect or Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). This will open a panel on the side of the screen. Navigate to the console tab to view the suggestion. Reload the page to get a new suggestion.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
